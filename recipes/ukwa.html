            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Ukwa soup, also known as African breadfruit soup, is a traditional Igbo delicacy in Nigeria, made from
                the cooking liquid or broth of boiled African breadfruit (Ukwa). It's a flavorful and nutritious soup,
                often enjoyed alongside the breadfruit porridge itself. The soup is known for its rich aroma and is
                considered a special treat within Igbo culture.
