            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Oha soup, also known as Ofe Oha, is a traditional Nigerian soup primarily made with Oha leaves, a
                seasonal leafy vegetable similar to bitter leaf, but more tender. It's a popular dish among the Igbo
                people of southeastern Nigeria. The soup is typically thickened with cocoyam, Achi, or Ofor and can be
                garnished with various meats and fish.
